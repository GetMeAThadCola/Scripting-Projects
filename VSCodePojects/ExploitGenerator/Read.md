# exploit generator

This code is a Python script for a simple port scanner with a graphical user interface (GUI) using the Tkinter library. 
It allows a user to enter an IP address, a range of ports (start and end), and then initiates a port scanning process. 
The script attempts to connect to each port in the specified range and identifies open ports. 
For each open port, it uses the nmap tool to identify the associated service running on that port. 
Additionally, the script queries an online exploit database to check if there are known exploits for the discovered service. 
The results are displayed in the console.

The GUI provides input fields for the user to specify the target IP address, start and end ports, and a "Scan Ports" button to initiate the scanning process. 
The user can expand on this code to further customize the GUI and improve its functionality.
