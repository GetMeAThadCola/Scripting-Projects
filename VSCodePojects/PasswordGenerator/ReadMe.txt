This Python script generates a random password of a specified length. 
It uses the string module to access sets of ASCII letters, digits, and punctuation characters.
 The random module is used to select random characters from these sets to form the password.

The generate_password() function takes an argument length, which represents the desired length of the password. 
Inside the function, it creates a characters string that contains alphanumeric characters and symbols. 
Then, it generates a password by randomly selecting characters from this set using random.choice() for the specified length.

The script sets the password_length variable to define the desired length of the password (in this case, 12 characters), and then calls the generate_password() function with this length to create a random password. 
Finally, it displays the generated password in the console.
