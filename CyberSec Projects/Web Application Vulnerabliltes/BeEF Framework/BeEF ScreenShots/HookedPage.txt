The BeEF (Browser Exploitation Framework) hook page is a web page hosted by the BeEF server that, when loaded in a target's browser, establishes a connection between the browser and the attacker's server.

This connection allows the attacker to remotely control and manipulate the target's browser, potentially carrying out various browser-based attacks. 

BeEF is used for ethical security testing and penetration testing to identify and mitigate browser vulnerabilities. 

As you can see this is the default hook page for beEF and you will see how we can see if you succesfully "hooked" a victim.
