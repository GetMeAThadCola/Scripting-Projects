For this one I attempted to make a pop up display hello (name).

Now since we know we can add HTML text formatting can we add a simple script.

I entered <script>alert("Hi Hunter")</script> and this was a success as you can see in the screenshot.

The next step was to try to make it display our sessions cookies in the pop up.
