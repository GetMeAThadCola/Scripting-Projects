In this screenshot we can see that we are setting the payload lists that BurpSuite will use in this Brute Force attack.

Note: Part of the assignement in the Bootcamp has supplied us with possible usernames and passwords to use.

The scenario we were given was that this fake company was the victim of a data breach and this information came from that.

In a real scenario you might use OSINT to figure out some usernames and possible passwords you can also use a wordlist with common usernames and passwords.
