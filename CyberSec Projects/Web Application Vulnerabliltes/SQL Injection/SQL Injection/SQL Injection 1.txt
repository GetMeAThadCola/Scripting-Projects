This is our first SQL Injection tried on this web app.

We have inputted a normal answer followed by ' to break out.

Then we add the common always true query of OR 1 = 1.

This will cause the database to return all of the values in the table.

Note 1 = 1 is the most common true statement but you can use alsmost anything as long as they are equal.

Examples : 
dog = dog 
cat = cat
cyber = cyber 
2 = 2
