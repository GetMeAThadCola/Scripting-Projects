Now this was a bonus question for my homework but I decided to keep this in.

If you need to go a step further you can use the CONCAT command to to combine two of fields to search into one field. 

An attacker might do this to get around the fact that the amount of fields requested has to match the amount from the orginal request.

The SQL Injection I then crafted for this probelm was :

1' UNION select CONCAT(first_name,last_name), password from users where '1' = '1

After putting this in I got this screenshot.
