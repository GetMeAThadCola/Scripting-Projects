Ethical Self-Phishing Experiment Using zphisher: A Security Awareness Case Study

I have only done this attack to myself. This was fully for educational purposes and to see how phishing attacks work first hand.

Basically I just wanted to start by seeing if I could pull my ip and this started with me going through alot of respositories on GITHUB to find the tool that works.

Eventually I landed on zphisher and I used that to attack myself.

I will include some screenshots of how it works.

Some skills learned/used in this expirement : 

Basic Cybersecurity Knowledge: A foundational understanding of cybersecurity concepts, including threats, vulnerabilities, and security best practices, is essential.

Phishing Awareness: Familiarity with common phishing techniques and the ability to recognize phishing emails and websites is crucial.

Linux/Unix Skills: Many hacking tools, including zphisher, are typically designed to run on Linux or Unix-based systems. Proficiency in these operating systems is beneficial.

Networking: Understanding networking fundamentals, such as TCP/IP, DNS, and HTTP, helps in comprehending how phishing attacks work.

Web Technologies: Knowledge of web technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and web servers, can be useful for understanding how phishing pages are constructed.

Scripting and Programming: Skills in scripting or programming languages like Python, Bash, or PHP can be beneficial for customizing and modifying phishing tools.

Security Tools: Familiarity with various security tools, such as Wireshark (for packet analysis), Nmap (for network scanning), and Burp Suite (for web application testing), can enhance your overall cybersecurity knowledge.

Ethical Hacking: An understanding of ethical hacking principles, methodologies, and frameworks like the OWASP Top Ten, can guide your experiment.

Consent and Ethical Considerations: Knowledge of ethical guidelines and the importance of obtaining informed consent before conducting any security experiment.

Documentation and Reporting: The ability to document your experiment thoroughly and write a clear and concise report is crucial for educational purposes and sharing your findings responsibly.

Legal and Ethical Compliance: Awareness of the legal and ethical implications of hacking, phishing, and data privacy laws in your jurisdiction.

Security Awareness: Being security-conscious and having the ability to think like an attacker to identify potential weaknesses and vulnerabilities.

I attempted to use localxpose server for my first attempt but googlechrome detected that it may be dangerous so it had the site listed as forbidden but I got the victims IP anyways now i blured out the IP as to not dox myself nut I have included screenshots of all of this.
