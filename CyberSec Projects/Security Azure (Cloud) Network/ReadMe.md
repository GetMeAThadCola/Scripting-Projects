# In the 24-week Cybersecurity BootCamp at ASU, one of the key projects involved setting up a virtual network in Microsoft Azure and implementing various security features to protect both the website hosted on the network and the network itself. 

## *This project aimed to provide hands-on experience configuring, securing, and monitoring a cloud-based infrastructure using Azure's cybersecurity tools and best practices.*

### You can see my Project Overview here:  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_sN2VdWgrdWn6MKvbBXcSwd4pL7JN1VgBvvkqaKsJbo/edit  unfortunately I do not have the same website as I had to shut it down due to cost.

## Some Skills acquired are:

1. Cloud Computing Proficiency: You gained a fundamental understanding of cloud computing principles, specifically within the context of Microsoft Azure.

2. Azure Virtual Network Setup: You learned how to create, configure, and manage virtual networks in Azure.

3. Subnet Configuration: You acquired skills in segmenting the virtual network into subnets for better resource management and security.

4. Network Security Groups (NSG): You learned how to define and apply security rules to control inbound and outbound traffic to network resources.

5. Azure Firewall Configuration: You gained experience setting up and configuring Azure Firewall to provide advanced security measures like deep packet inspection and threat protection.

6. Security Monitoring and Logging: You became proficient in using Azure's monitoring and logging tools, such as Azure Security Center, Azure Monitor, and Azure Log Analytics to track and analyze network activities.

7. Security Policy Definition: You developed the ability to define custom security policies to meet specific security requirements and compliance standards.

8. Incident Response: You learned how to detect and respond to security incidents by setting up alerts and defining appropriate response procedures.

9. Security Auditing and Assessment: You acquired skills in conducting security assessments and audits to evaluate the network's security posture and identify vulnerabilities.

10. Documentation and Reporting: You gained experience in creating comprehensive documentation for network configurations, security measures, and incident response plans.

11. Communication and Presentation: Through the final assessment and presentation, you likely improved your communication and presentation skills, which are crucial for conveying complex technical information to stakeholders.

12. Hands-on Experience: This project provided practical, hands-on experience, which is invaluable for understanding the practical application of cybersecurity concepts and tools.
