In the 24-week Cybersecurity BootCamp at ASU, one of the key projects involved setting up a virtual network in Microsoft Azure and implementing various security features to protect both the website hosted on the network and the network itself. 

This project aimed to provide hands-on experience in configuring, securing, and monitoring a cloud-based infrastructure using Azure's cybersecurity tools and best practices.

You can see my Project Overview here:  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_sN2VdWgrdWn6MKvbBXcSwd4pL7JN1VgBvvkqaKsJbo/edit    unfotunatley I do not have the same website as I had to shut it down due to cost.

Some Skills Aquired Are :

Cloud Computing Proficiency: You gained a fundamental understanding of cloud computing principles, specifically within the context of Microsoft Azure.

Azure Virtual Network Setup: You learned how to create, configure, and manage virtual networks in Azure.

Subnet Configuration: You acquired skills in segmenting the virtual network into subnets for better resource management and security.

Network Security Groups (NSG): You learned how to define and apply security rules to control inbound and outbound traffic to network resources.

Azure Firewall Configuration: You gained experience in setting up and configuring Azure Firewall to provide advanced security measures like deep packet inspection and threat protection.

Virtual Private Network (VPN) Configuration: You learned how to establish secure connections between on-premises networks and Azure through the use of VPN gateways.

Security Monitoring and Logging: You became proficient in using Azure's monitoring and logging tools, such as Azure Security Center, Azure Monitor, and Azure Log Analytics to track and analyze network activities.

Security Policy Definition: You developed the ability to define custom security policies to meet specific security requirements and compliance standards.

Incident Response: You learned how to detect and respond to security incidents by setting up alerts and defining appropriate response procedures.

Security Auditing and Assessment: You acquired skills in conducting security assessments and audits to evaluate the network's security posture and identify vulnerabilities.

Documentation and Reporting: You gained experience in creating comprehensive documentation for network configurations, security measures, and incident response plans.

Communication and Presentation: Through the final assessment and presentation, you likely improved your communication and presentation skills, which are crucial for conveying complex technical information to stakeholders.

Hands-on Experience: This project provided practical, hands-on experience, which is invaluable for understanding the practical application of cybersecurity concepts and tools.

Teamwork: If the project involved collaboration with peers, you also developed teamwork and collaboration skills, which are important in real-world cybersecurity settings.
