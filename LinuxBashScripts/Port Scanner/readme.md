# Port Scanner

This Bash script, authored by Hunter Carbone, is a basic network port scanner that utilizes Nmap. 
It prompts the user to enter a target network or IP address, checks for validity, and scans for open ports in the range of 1-65535 using Nmap.
If the Nmap scan is successful, it displays the results; otherwise, it reports an error. 
This script is a quick way to assess open ports on a target system.
