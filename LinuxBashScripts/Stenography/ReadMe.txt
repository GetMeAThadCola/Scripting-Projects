This Bash script checks for the presence of hidden data within an image file and, if found, extracts it using the 'steghide' tool. 
It does this by first ensuring that a valid image file is provided as an argument and that the file exists. 
Then, it calls the has_something_to_extract function, which, in this example, checks if the image file's size exceeds 100 bytes. 
If something is deemed extractable, the script proceeds to use 'steghide' to extract any concealed messages. 
If the extraction is successful, it informs the user, and if not, it reports that there's nothing to extract. 
This script is useful for uncovering hidden data in images, making it particularly relevant in steganography and cybersecurity applications. 
To adapt it for specific use cases, you can adjust the extraction criteria in the has_something_to_extract function.
